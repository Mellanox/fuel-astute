# `attributes' section describe attributes of OpenStack installation.
attributes:
  # `deployment_mode' shows what type of installation you choose.
  # Can be:
  #   `singlenode_compute' - means only one node will be deployed. It will
  #      contain Controller and Compute components of OpenStack.
  #   `multinode_compute' - means one Controller node and some Compute nodes
  #      will be deployed.
  #   `ha_compute' - means at least three Controller nodes and some Compute
  #      nodes will be deployed in High Availability mode of Controller
  #      components.
  #   In last two cases Astute first of all deployes Contoller components,
  #   after that it deployes Compute components and finaly deployes other
  #   components if they exist.
  deployment_mode: multinode_compute
  # `deployment_engine' - shows how you will handle attributes for Puppet
  # manifests.
  #   `simplepuppet' - means you should manualy set up all necessary attributes
  #      in your site.pp file. This engine simply run Puppet agent on the
  #      client's side. In this case Puppet agent uses attributes from site.pp.
  #   `nailyfact' - means it automaticaly calculate some necessary attributes
  #      e.g. `controller_node_public' address. Also it store necessary
  #      attributes on the node's side. In this case Puppet agent uses these
  #      attributes via `facts'.
  deployment_engine: simplepuppet

  # All other attributes are optional and make sence for `nailyfact' deployment
  # engine only.
